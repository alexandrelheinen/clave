"""The conveyor: spawning, carrying, and reachability.

MuJoCo has no conveyor primitive. Objects are free bodies whose horizontal
velocity is driven to the belt speed while they rest on the belt, leaving
vertical motion, rotation and contact to physics. This is a driven constraint
rather than a friction model, which is the honest description: objects do not
slip, and a real line's slip is a disturbance this world does not reproduce.

**The rotation is left to physics, and that was measured four ways.** With the
belt driving the centre velocity and the belt's friction acting under it, a
parcel turns at up to 5.4 radians per second on its way down the belt, which is
155 degrees over the half second between the capture that claims a grasp yaw and
the instant the jaws close. Every repair on this side of the seam was tried and
measured against the same 60 second run, and every one of them cost more than it
bought:

| Repair | Pad-to-belt contact | Worst vertical lurch | Grasps held |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| none, as shipped | −0.6 mm over 4 ticks | 99 m/s² | 1 of 7 |
| the spin pinned to zero each tick | **−2.8 mm, 54 ticks** | **934 m/s²** | none of 7 |
| the spin damped, 0.3 s constant | **−18.6 mm, 17 ticks** | 170 m/s² | none of 8 |

Pinning turns the belt's drag into a reaction that tips the parcel over.
Damping leaves the parcels lying flat, which puts more of them under a jaw that
then closes on a flat parcel's upper edge and is pulled down onto the belt. So
the rotation stays where it is and the yaw is carried forward on the control
side instead, which is written up in
[measurements.md](measurements.md#what-the-reported-run-turned-out-to-be).

An object that passes the reachable window is left alone. A real line does not
stop, so an unpicked object is a throughput loss rather than a fault.
