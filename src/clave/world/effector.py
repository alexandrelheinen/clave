"""The end effector the pick geometry assumes.

CLAVE has no gripper. Nothing in the model closes on an object and nothing in
the repository has ever grasped one, so every dimension here is an assumption
read from configuration rather than a measurement. The type exists so that
assumption is written in one place, reviewed like any other tunable, and
replaced wholesale the day a real effector is specified.

The jaw opening is not a field of its own. It is `arm.max_grasp_width_meters`,
which already decides which objects the world may spawn, and reading it from
there is what keeps a marker from calling an object unreachable that the world
was told to produce.

    Attributes:
        finger_length: How far the pads sit below the face the tool bolts to,
            in meters. This is the offset between where an object is and where
            the flange has to be.
        pad_thickness: One pad's extent along the closing direction, in
            meters, which is the way it travels to close.
        pad_depth: One pad's extent across the closing direction and
            horizontal, in meters.
        pad_height: One pad's vertical extent, in meters.
        grasp_height: Where the pads close, measured up from the belt surface,
            in meters. A configured plane rather than a reading, because no
            sensor on this line estimates an object's height.
        lowest_below_flange: How far the jaw's lowest collision geometry reaches
            below the flange, in meters, at its lowest over the jaw's own
            travel. Measured with the jaw shut, and larger than `finger_length`
            on the shipped jaw: the pads hang below the point the jaw closes at,
            so a clearance quoted at that point is not a clearance the jaw has.
        open_lowest_below_flange: The same reach with the jaw open, in meters.
            The linkage hangs less far open than shut, and the descent arrives
            against this one. The hold then rises by the difference while the
            jaw closes, which is what keeps the shut reach at the same clearance.
        jaw_clearance: The clearance the jaw's lowest geometry keeps above the
            belt surface, in meters.
        opening: The widest the jaw goes, in meters, read from the arm.
