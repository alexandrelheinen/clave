"""What proposes a pick, and the identity problem underneath it.

Two predictors share one interface. The scripted one is the expert the policies
were trained to imitate, and it exists so the loop can be exercised on a machine
with no deep learning framework installed. The checkpoint one loads the models
trained at v0.7.0 and is what the reported figures come from.

Neither tracks. CLAVE has no tracker, so the identity a proposal carries comes
from the simulator by associating the predicted point with the nearest labeled
object. A real line needs a tracker and this is where it plugs in; until then,
every identity in a run is ground truth and no reported number should be read as
evidence that identity was recovered from pixels.
