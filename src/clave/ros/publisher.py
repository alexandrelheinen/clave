"""Publishing one decision on a ROS 2 topic.

The mapping onto `vision_msgs/Detection3D` is stated in
`crates/clave-decision/contract/ros-decision.md`, which is what a subscriber
implements against. Two properties of this module are deliberate.

It computes every value it will publish before it touches ROS, in
[fields_for], so the mapping is testable on a machine with no installation. And
it imports ROS inside the function that needs it, so importing this module costs
nothing and a machine without ROS gets a sentence rather than a traceback.
