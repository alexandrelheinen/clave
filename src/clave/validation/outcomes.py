"""What happened to one object, and the set of those records a run scores.

The record below is a placeholder. v0.6.0 owns rollout capture and will publish
the real format, at which point this file's reader is deleted and one adapter
converts a rollout record into these fields. Nothing else has to move, because
every metric in this package is a function of the fields rather than of the
file: no metric opens a path, and no metric knows that a JSON representation
exists.

A record describes an object that was presented to the system, meaning it
entered the arm's reachable window. An object that never entered the window is
outside this harness's boundary, since nothing could have been done about it.
