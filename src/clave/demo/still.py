"""Capturing a still of the sorting world.

A still is a frame of a real rollout, chosen by when it happens rather than by
arranging anything: the world runs from a seed with the scripted expert driving
the arm at approach height from the park pose, and the renderer is asked for a
frame at a stated instant. Nothing is drawn on it, composited into it or
corrected afterwards. The encoder writes the pixels the renderer produced.

The lighting and the camera come from the still's own file and are handed to
the world as an argument, so `configs/world/sorting_line.yml` is the file every
dataset, training run and benchmark reads and this changes none of it.

One, meaning the solved angles are commanded outright. The arm's own position
actuators already implement a proportional-derivative loop, so interpolating the
setpoint on top of them adds a second lag, and a target riding a belt at 0.31 m/s
exposes it: at 0.35 the tool settled 1.13 m behind the object it was following,
against 35 mm when the setpoint is commanded directly.

The previous arm hid this. It was light and its targets were nearly static at the
scale its workspace covered, so a fractional setpoint looked like smoothing
rather than lag.
