Frames go to `ffmpeg` on standard input as raw `rgb24`. That needs no imaging
library in the wheel and no new dependency, and it keeps the encoder a tool the
operator already has rather than one this project pins.

A machine without `ffmpeg` runs the scenario anyway. A missing encoder means no
video, not a failed demonstration.
