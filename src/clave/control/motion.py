"""The pose to command this tick, on a path the arm can follow.

A phase says where it wants the flange. It does not say how to get there, and
commanding the goal outright is how a controller asks for a jump the actuators
answer with a lunge. Motion is the layer in between: a straight line in task
space, which is what an industrial linear move is, walked under configured
speed and acceleration ceilings.

**The first argument is the reference, not the measurement.** Motion
integrates its own previous output, seeded once from where the flange stood.
Stepping from the measured flange instead makes the reference chase the plant
rather than lead it.

**The path is kept inside a region that is not convex.** The arm is trusted
over an annulus from world configuration, so a straight line between two
admitted poses can still pass through the hole around the base. Each stepped
pose is handed to a projection that pushes it back into the trusted region.

**A goal that rides the belt is aimed ahead of itself.** The goal carries the
instant it was seen, and the intercept is carried from there to now plus the
traverse. Belt speed is known here rather than estimated.
