"""One visit, planned end to end before the arm moves.

The task machine used to hold a pose and wait for the flange to reach it.
That is enough to follow an object and not enough to pick one up: a jaw has
to arrive at a known instant, moving with the object, having come straight
down onto it, and none of those is available from a controller that finds
out when it arrives by arriving.

So a visit is planned as a sequence of timed arcs, each one's end being the
next one's start, and the arm is driven by the clock rather than by
proximity. [clave.control.trajectory] holds the arc algebra and
`docs/trajectory-formulation.md` the mathematics; this holds the sequence.

**The interception time is solved once; the aim is not.** A duration that
keeps changing is a duration nothing can be scheduled against, so `T` is
fixed at commit. Where the arm is aiming is refreshed every capture until
the descent begins, because the belt model carries the x axis exactly and
carries nothing else: an object rolling or settling drifts sideways out
from under a pose predicted three seconds ago. See [refine].

**The hold is a carry, not a stop.** While the jaw closes, the belt keeps
moving and the flange has to move with it. A quintic whose endpoints differ
by exactly the velocity times the duration, with that velocity at both ends
and no acceleration, reduces to a straight line at constant speed, so the
carry is the same object as every other arc rather than a special case.

    The approach was solved against an earlier estimate. Once the flange is
    on the way down, that estimate is at most one steer old, and the object
    has whatever velocity it has now. Rebuilding the whole visit would send
    the arm back up. The arrival stays the instant already chosen. What moves
    is the end of the descent, and the carry and the retreat are hung off
    that end the same way a fresh plan would.

    Args:
        plan: The active visit, already on its descent.
        object_position: Where the object is now.
        belt_velocity: How it is moving.
        approach_clearance_z: The clearance the descent was planned through.
        approach_speed: How fast the descent was coming down.
        dwell_seconds: How long the jaw stays shut.
        max_speed: Speed ceiling, in meters per second.
        max_acceleration: Acceleration ceiling, in meters per second squared.
        at_seconds: Simulated time.
        drift_horizon: How long a lateral velocity is carried.
        retreat_lift: How far the retreat climbs, when it differs from the
            clearance.
        over: The chute mouth the delivery was heading for, or None.
        belt_border_y: The belt edge the delivery crosses.
        safe_height_world: The height the delivery clears the barrier at.
        cross_speed: How fast the delivery crosses that edge.
        jaw_rise: How far the flange climbs while the jaw shuts, in meters.
            Ignored when `clearance_flange_z` is set.
        clearance_flange_z: The flange height at which the shut jaw is already

    Returns:
        The visit from this instant on, or None when this instant is not
        inside the descent or no positive fraction of the correction stays
        under the speed ceiling. None leaves the caller on the plan it
        already has. The descent's duration is already fixed, and that
        duration is what sets its acceleration, so the acceleration ceiling
        that gates an approach does not gate this splice: the descent
