"""The phases of one visit, and the pose each phase asks for.

A visit is what the arm does about one object: go to it, stay with it long
enough to prove it arrived, and move on. The machine says which phase it is
in and where it wants the flange; it decides nothing about the path there,
which is motion, and nothing about joint angles, which is the servo.

Under the motion-only profile the phases are standby, tracking, parking and
fault. That is what tuning arm speed against belt speed needs: the flange
rides at approach height the whole time, so nothing about a descent muddies
what a distance figure means.

**A full visit is planned, not stepped.** The motion-only path asks for a
pose and finds out when it arrives by arriving, which is enough to follow an
object and not enough to pick one up: a jaw has to reach an object at a
known instant, moving with it, having come straight down onto it. So the
full-visit path hands the whole visit to [clave.control.pick] the moment it
commits to a candidate, gets back a sequence of timed arcs, and thereafter
drives the arm from the clock rather than from proximity.

That makes the two profiles differ in how they are driven and not only in
how many phases they run, which is why a caller asks [TaskMachine.active]
which regime it is in rather than reading the phase.

**A plan owns which object and when; not where.** Re-deciding which object
a visit is about would turn an interception into a chase, and re-deciding
the arrival time would leave nothing able to schedule against it, so both
are fixed the moment the machine commits. Where the jaw closes is not. The
aim is refreshed on every new estimate until the jaw shuts, because the
belt model predicts travel along the belt and predicts a roll across it
only for as long as that roll lasts, and an object drifts out from under a
pose solved three seconds ago. Through the approach the arc is bent onto
the fresher estimate. Once the descent has started there is no approach
left to bend, and solving the visit again would send the arm back up, so
only the end of the descent moves. A correction that breaks a ceiling
leaves the plan already in hand.

**A refresh that cannot follow the object is answered, not ignored.** An
approach arc can only be bent so far, and an object that has fallen behind
its own prediction -- one dragging on the belt, or one that has stopped
drifting across it -- cannot be met by an arc already committed further
downstream. The refinement is refused, and a machine that reacts by running
the plan it already had descends onto bare belt while reporting a
millimetre arrival error against its own commands. So the freshest estimate
is compared with the pose the plan is aiming at: inside the configured
tolerance the refusal is noise and the plan flies, past it the visit is
solved again from the freshest estimate and may well choose a later
interception, and when no interception exists at all the visit is abandoned
with its reason recorded. Both cases are in the run's report, which is the
only way to tell a machine that gave up on an object from one that never
saw it.

A refusal is the one thing that tears a plan up, because a pose the solver
will not take is a pose the rest of the sequence was built on.

        It cannot always. An object dragging on the belt, or one that has
