"""One commanded pose, turned into joint angles and written to the actuators.

The only module in the control path that compiles a model, and the only one
with no decisions in it. It takes the pose motion produced, asks
`clave.world.arm` for joint angles that put the flange there with the tool
vertical, and writes them.

**It leads the plant rather than following it.** These are position
actuators running a proportional-derivative loop, so the measured flange
trails a moving command by a lag proportional to the commanded speed.
Measured on the shipped arm by sweeping a target from 0.15 to 1.00 metres
per second, that lag divided by the speed is 32.8 to 38.6 milliseconds and
is otherwise flat, which is what makes it a time constant rather than a
distance. Commanding the pose the reference will hold one such constant
from now cancels most of it.

That is not cosmetic. With the jaw's clear opening at 85.2 mm, the widest
object left in the set leaves 8.7 mm of side clearance, and a flange
trailing by more than that closes the jaw onto the object rather than
around it.

It reports a refusal rather than swallowing one. `arm.step_toward` leaves the
command untouched for a target outside the trusted region, which is correct
for a controller and useless for a report: an arm that quietly stops moving
looks identical to an arm that arrived. So the reach is checked here and the
refusal travels back, which is what lets the task machine fault the track and
the run count it.
