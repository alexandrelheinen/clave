"""Trajectories with known duration, so an interception time can be solved for.

Guidance until now stepped a reference toward a goal under a speed and an
acceleration bound, which is enough to arrive somewhere and not enough to
pick anything up. Arriving is not the problem: a jaw has to reach an object
at a known instant, moving with it, having come straight down onto it. That
needs a trajectory whose duration is a parameter rather than an outcome.

**Quintic Hermite segments, one per axis.** A quintic has six coefficients
and a segment has six boundary conditions per axis: position, velocity and
acceleration at each end. So the polynomial is determined exactly by what
the phase asks for, in closed form, with no fitting and no solver. That is
also why a quintic and not a B-spline: the requirement is control of
acceleration at the waypoints, and a Hermite form states the acceleration
there as a coefficient rather than approaching it through control points.

**The interception time is a fixed point.** Where the arm must be depends on
how long it takes to get there, because the belt carries the object while
the arm travels. Written out, the approach point is

    p_approach(T) = p_object(t0) + v_object * (T + dt) + (0, 0, z_offset)

and the segment reaching it has to respect the speed and acceleration
ceilings over its whole length. Peak speed and peak acceleration both fall
as `T` grows, so the smallest feasible `T` is found by bisection on a
monotone predicate rather than by an optimiser. It is suboptimal and it is
knowably suboptimal: what the pick needs is a duration it can count on, not
the shortest one that exists.

**The descent duration is not free.** In the frame moving with the belt the
descent is purely vertical, from height `z_offset` at speed `V_approach` to
rest on the object. Writing the quintic in `u = 1 - s` and reading the
leading term, which is cubic because position, velocity and acceleration
all vanish at the end, gives the exact condition for never passing below
the object:

    dt <= 5 * z_offset / (2 * V_approach)

This uses `2 * z_offset / V_approach`, four fifths of that limit, which
leaves margin rather than sitting on a boundary. Acceleration is not the
binding constraint here, so there is nothing to buy by stretching toward it,
and a shorter descent keeps the prediction horizon short, which is the
reason the clearance is small in the first place.

**Both ends move with the belt.** The terminal velocity at the pick is the
object's own, not zero, and the approach velocity is the object's plus the
descent. Two things follow and both are large. A jaw arriving at rest has
the object sliding through it at belt speed, which is the one thing a grasp
cannot tolerate. And the horizontal catch-up a stationary approach forces
dominates the descent: matching the object instead dropped peak acceleration
from 4.58 to 0.94 metres per second squared at the shipped clearance, a
factor of about five, with the slip at the jaw going from 0.314 m/s to zero.

    its velocity is the belt's, it holds for as long as the belt does, and
    carrying it over a four second visit is right. Across the belt nothing
    drives it. The drift comes from a parcel turning or being nudged, it decays
    within a fraction of a second, and measured on the shipped line its
    autocorrelation is +0.04 after 0.2 s and −0.02 after 0.8 s: it is a

    two visits in nine commanded a pose 208 and 346 mm from any object, outside
    the region the arm is trusted over, and the arm fell 50 to 80 mm behind the
    command while the jaws closed on nothing.
