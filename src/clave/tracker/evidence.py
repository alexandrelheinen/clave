"""What one sensor reading becomes, and the five shapes it can take.

An adapter converts one sensor reading into one or more `Evidence` values. The
envelope is common and the payload is a tagged union, which is what lets a
consumer read a fused record without knowing that a camera exists.

Two rules give the union its value.

A variant states what was **measured**, never what should be **done**. No
payload carries a channel, a grasp or an instruction, so no adapter can start
deciding things the routing policy and the effector own. A test walks the
fields of every variant and enforces it, because the rule is easy to agree with
and easy to break.

Adding a variant is additive. A consumer that does not know one keeps working,
because it reads the fused record rather than the evidence stream, and a
fusion rule that does not recognize a payload reports the miss rather than
raising.

`GroundTruth` sits in the same union as the rest on purpose. It is how
simulation supplies labels through the path real sensors use, so the training
pipeline cannot come to depend on a shape that exists only in simulation. A
runtime configured for hardware refuses it, and that refusal lives at the
intake rather than here, because a payload that cannot be constructed cannot be
tested.

`PixelMask` lives in this module rather than beside the adapter that builds it.
A mask is data, the adapter is behavior, and putting the type next to the
adapter would have `evidence` importing `adapters` while `adapters` constructs
`Evidence`.
