"""The seam, and the one implementation of it this spec ships.

Everything the two-spec split promises rests on the three names here.
`learned-tracker` replaces `SimulatorIdentity` with a trained model and changes
nothing above the protocol, and that promise is only checkable because `Cue` is
a closed type. What a learned model may look at is a dataclass a reviewer reads
in one sitting, rather than a rule somebody is trusted to keep.

An implementation is a pure function of its two arguments. It reads no clock,
opens no file, draws no random number and keeps nothing between calls, so a
replay of the same cues in the same order produces the same associations.
Every track it receives has already been propagated to the cue's instant by the
caller, so no implementation dead reckons and `belt_frame.propagate` has one
call site. `Tracker` is what holds state.

**`Cue` has no `previous` field, and the design document said it would.** The
tracks argument already carries the previous state of every open track, and a
seam whose whole value is being diffable should not carry the same thing twice.
The maintainer's framing, that the model sees the footprint, the pick point, an
optional code and the previous track state, is satisfied by `tracks`.

**`Cue.label` is the one field that makes this seam imperfect, and it is
deliberate.** A detection carries no identity, because the adapter throws away
the only one it has. Ground truth legitimately does
carry one, and the whole point of the shipped associator is that it uses it, so
that `learned-tracker` has something to be measured against. The alternative,
matching ground truth geometrically too, would mean this spec had already taken
identity away from the simulator and left the next one with no baseline.
`AC-TRACK-33` holds the learned model to building its input without this field.
