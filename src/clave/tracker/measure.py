"""Counting decodes, and naming every denominator they could be counted against.

A decode yield is a fraction, and the interesting question is what is under the
line. Of 45 objects crossing the gate on the shipped line, all 45 now fall
inside a code camera's band, but that was 29 before the optics were grounded in
real parts, and the two denominators gave 3.4 and 2.2 percent for the same two
decodes. `AC-TRACK-47` requires both because a single figure misleads in one
direction or the other.

An object no camera could see did not fail to decode; it was never presented.
Counting it against the decoder blames optics on software, which is exactly the
confusion this project already made once when it read a gate covering 0.704 m of
a 1.00 m belt as covering 1.252 m of it.

Nothing here renders. The source is a protocol so the arithmetic is provable
against a fake, and the script that drives a real world lives outside this
module.
