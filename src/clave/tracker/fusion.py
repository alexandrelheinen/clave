"""Folding one reading into a belief, and the rules that make it trustworthy.

Three decisions here are load bearing, and each is a property of a signature
rather than of a comment.

**Conflict never resolves by source.** `weight_of` takes a confidence and an
elapsed time, and no function in this module accepts a `source_id`. Source
priority is not forbidden by a rule that somebody could forget; it is
unrepresentable, because there is nothing to prioritize by. A sensor is trusted
for what it reported and how sure it was, so adding one cannot silently reorder
the others.

**Elapsed time is clamped at zero.** A weight of the form `k ** elapsed`
inverts when elapsed is negative, so a reading older than the belief it joins
would outweigh a newer one. The contract anticipates two cameras firing 8 ms
apart, which is exactly when that happens, so the clamp is a rule here.

**Nothing ever reaches zero.** A class every reading so far dismissed would be
dismissed forever, because zero is unrecoverable under multiplication. The floor
is configuration rather than a constant here, for the same reason the world's
numbers are.

The fold table is an explicit dict rather than single dispatch, so what happens
to a payload nobody wrote a rule for has exactly one address to read.
