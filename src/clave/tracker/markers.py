"""The grasp pose, as geometry in the world.

A marker is what the tracker believes, standing in the scene where it believes
it. One per open track, coloured by the track's identity, showing where a jaw
would close, how wide it would open, and which way it would be turned.

This is geometry and not an overlay, and the difference is the whole reason
the module exists. An overlay is painted onto a frame after the renderer is
done with it, so it argues for something the simulator never drew. A marker is
pushed into the scene before the render, so MuJoCo shades it, occludes it
behind the arm, and moves it with the camera exactly as it does every other
solid. `agents/claude.md` forbids the first and permits the second.

Two parts of the pose are derived and one is assumed. The horizontal position,
the closing axis and the opening all come from the record's footprint, which
came from pixels. The height does not: the gate looks straight down, no sensor
on this line estimates depth, and a `WasteObject` here carries no height at
all. So the pad plane is a configured standoff read from
[clave.world.effector.Effector], and this docstring is where that is admitted
rather than in a comment nobody reaches.

            the record. A pose and the window it holds for travel together
            here for the same reason they travel together in the published
            decision: a pose with no expiry is a pose somebody will use late.
        pinch_position_belt: Where the pads would close, in belt frame meters.
        flange_position_world: Where the face the tool bolts to would sit.
        pad_positions_belt: The pad centers in belt frame, or an empty tuple when
            the footprint has no axis to turn a jaw to.
        pad_size: One pad's half-extents, in its own frame: along the closing
            direction, across it, and vertical.
        closing_yaw_belt: Rotation of the closing direction about the belt normal,
            in radians, or None when the footprint is not oriented.
        opening: How far the jaw would have to open, in meters.
        oriented: Whether `closing_yaw_belt` means anything.
        reachable: Whether the effector opens that wide at all.
        extent: The footprint's larger horizontal side, which sizes the disc
            drawn when there is no axis.
        color: The track's color, as red, green and blue in the unit range.
        channel: Where the object routes to, resolved from its material
            class. Carried here because the arm has to know which chute to
            release over, and the alternative is the task layer resolving a
            taxonomy identifier it has no other reason to hold.
        velocity_world: How the belt is carrying it, or None when nothing

        yaw_rate_belt: How fast it is turning about the belt normal, in radians

            claim made once per capture and the jaws close up to half a second
            later, so a tool sent to the claimed yaw arrives wherever the
            object has turned to since: the caller turns the tool to where the
