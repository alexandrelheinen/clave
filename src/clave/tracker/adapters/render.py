"""The one bridge between this package and the simulator.

Every other module in `clave.tracker` works from data a test can write as a
literal. This one turns a MuJoCo segmentation render into that data, and it is
the only module in the package that imports MuJoCo. The import sits inside the
function rather than at module scope, so the package stays importable on a
machine with no simulator, which is the property the quality gate rests on.

Nothing here converts a coordinate or decides anything. It reads pixels and
hands back runs.
