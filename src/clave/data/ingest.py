"""Ingesting a real corpus.

The mappings below mirror `docs/waste-taxonomy.md`, which is the authority. Most
corpus labels are coarser than the taxonomy, so a mapping loses information, and
the loss is recorded rather than resolved by picking a class.

TrashNet and ZeroWaste are fetched, digested in `corpora/manifest.toml`, and
read here. What each archive holds and what its mapping costs are recorded in
`docs/research/corpus-ingestion.md`. The remaining shortlisted corpora are
unfetched, and declaring a layout for one before its bytes are in hand would be
a guess, so :data:`CORPUS_LAYOUTS` and :data:`CORPUS_ANNOTATIONS` describe only
what has been read.

The two corpora need two readers because they make two different claims.
TrashNet writes one label per image in a directory name, so
:class:`CorpusArchive` reads a path. ZeroWaste annotates regions inside an
image, several per frame and often of different materials, so
:class:`LocalizedArchive` reads a COCO annotation file and carries a box per
region. Flattening ZeroWaste into one label per image would throw away exactly
the property that makes it the strongest corpus on the shortlist.

A fetched image is a :class:`CorpusExample` rather than a
:class:`clave.data.examples.Example`. The two are different claims. A simulated
example carries object positions and pixel boxes the world knows by
construction, and one taxonomy class per object. A whole-image corpus label
carries none of that: TrashNet's `plastic` names four classes at once and no
region at all. Forcing it into the simulated type would mean inventing a
position and choosing one of the four, which is exactly the fabrication the
ambiguity record exists to prevent.

Nothing here decodes an image. Ingestion needs the label vocabulary and the
bytes; which library turns a JPEG into pixels is the caller's decision, and
keeping it out means this module runs wherever the standard library does.
