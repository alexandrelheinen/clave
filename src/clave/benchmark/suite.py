"""Running every configuration and turning each run into scored records.

The population a record describes is an object that entered the reachable
window, which is the definition the validation harness already uses: an object
that never came within reach is outside this harness's boundary, since nothing
could have been done about it.

Every record carries `picked = False`. Nothing in CLAVE grasps anything, so pick
success and cycle time are unmeasurable rather than zero, and the evidence pack
says so in those words instead of publishing a rate.
