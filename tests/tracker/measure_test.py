"""Counting decodes, and naming every denominator they could be counted against.

Covers `AC-TRACK-15` and `AC-TRACK-47`.

The arithmetic is tested against a fake frame source, so the counting is
provable without a render. What a render is needed for is the number itself,
which `docs/measurements.md` carries.
