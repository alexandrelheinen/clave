"""Folding evidence into a belief, and the two rules that make it trustworthy.



Two tests here are the reason the module is shaped the way it is. The
source-swap test folds two disagreeing readings, then folds the same two with
their provenance exchanged, and demands the same answer. The out-of-order test
folds a reading older than the belief it is folded into and demands it does not
outweigh a newer one, which is the case a weight of the form `k ** elapsed`
inverts.
