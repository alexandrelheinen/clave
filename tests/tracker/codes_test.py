"""Reading a symbol, and resolving it to what the package is made of.



The decoder runs against a committed fixture, so a zero rendered yield reads
as a property of the optics rather than as breakage. The
fixture is a symbol on a pinned submodule texture: `docs/guidelines.md` says no
binary lands in git, and a submodule pin is a reference rather than a binary.

Generating the symbol instead was tried and abandoned. OpenCV detects before it
decodes and will not detect a synthetic symbol at any module width, quiet zone
or canvas padding, so a generated fixture would have proved only that the
generator and the decoder disagree.
