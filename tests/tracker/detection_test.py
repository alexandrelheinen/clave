"""Turning pixels into a footprint, and throwing away what the render leaks.



The trap this file guards is the render leaking identity. A MuJoCo
segmentation render is keyed by geometry name, that name is `object_<slot>`,
and `clave.world.belt` makes the slot the same integer the world hands out as
`ObjectLabel.object_id`.
An adapter that passed the key through would hand the tracker the answer while
appearing to perceive it.
