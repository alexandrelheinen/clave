"""Reading the line's sensors, and never reading one by name.

Covers `AC-TRACK-02`, `AC-TRACK-25` and `AC-TRACK-25b`.

The contract's claim is that adding, moving or removing a camera changes
`configs/world/sorting_line.yml` and nothing else. That claim is only worth
anything if no module reaches for a camera by its id, which is what the last
test in this file enforces.
